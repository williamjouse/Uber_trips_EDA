# Uber Trips Exploration Analysis


Analyzing how much we spend on Uber trips, knowing how many trips we have done in the month, and the user's preferred destination 
are questions that we can ask from the data provided by the Uber application. Exploratory data analysis is one of the first steps 
in data science. This initial analysis is crucial because we acquire more knowledge about the data and answer some questions before 
creating machine learning models.


In this mini-project, we answer some questions such as:

1. What is the relationship between distance, fare amount, and trip duration?
2. How many completed trips were made in previous years?
3. What are the maximum, minimum, and average fare, distance, and trip time?
4. What is the total fare amount for each month and year?
5. How many trips were made each year divided by the day of the week?
6. What period had the highest average fares?
7. What was the average velocity of the trips?
